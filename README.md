Data Standardization for medical datasets

Abstract: Medical data processing and analytics exert significant influence in furnishing dependable decision support for prospective biomedical applications. Given the sensitive nature of medical data, specialized techniques and frameworks tailored for application-centric processing are imperative. This article presents a conceptualization for the analysis and uniformitarian of datasets through the implementation of Federated Learning (FL). The realm of medical big data stems from diverse origins, necessitating the delineation of data provenance and attribute paradigms to facilitate feature extraction and dependency assessment. The architecture governing the data collection framework is intricately linked to remote data transmission, thereby engendering efficient customization oversight. The operational methodology unfolds across four strata: the data origin layer, data acquisition layer, data classification layer, and data optimization layer. Central to this endeavor are multi-objective optimal datasets (MooM), characterized by attribute-driven feature cartography and cluster categorization through the conduit of federated learning models. The orchestration of feature synchronization and parameter extraction transpires across multiple tiers of neural networking, culminating in the provisioning of a steadfast remedy through dataset standardization and labeling. The empirical findings reflect the efficacy of the proposed technique, boasting an impressive 97.34% accuracy rate in the disentanglement and clustering of telemedicine data, facilitated by the operational servers within the ambit of the federated model
